# This is how yaml properties configurations can be set in the same file for multiple profiles
# Here see the "service" is the same prefix called in the configuration and will inject the same-name values.

# This is separator for configurations "---"
# It will be called only when the profile "cloud" (or whatever name is specified on-profile)
# is called/set/activated. (hence the name activate on-profile duh)
# If no profile is set then the configurations above (aka the defaults) will be set.
